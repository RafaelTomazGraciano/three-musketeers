=== Union Size Test ===

Union sizes (should be size of largest member):
  Small union (char, int): stores int
  Large union (int, double): stores double
  Mixed union (char, int, double): stores double

Memory sharing test:
Small union:
  Set s.i = 65
  s.i = 65
  s.c = A (shares memory with s.i)

Large union:
  Set l.i = 1078523331
  l.i = 1078523331
  l.d = 0.000000 (shares memory, different interpretation)

Mixed union:
  Set m.d = 0.0, then m.i = 255
  m.i = 255
  m.c = �
  m.d = 0.000000 (corrupted by integer write)
