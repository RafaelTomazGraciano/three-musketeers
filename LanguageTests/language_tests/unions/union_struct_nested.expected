=== Union with Nested Struct Test ===

Test 1 - Store radius:
  s1.radius = 10

Test 2 - Store point:
  s1.center.x = 5
  s1.center.y = 7
  s1.radius = 5 (corrupted)

Test 3 - Store area:
  s1.area = 314.159000

Test 4 - Union inside struct:
  Container ID: 100
  Shape radius: 15
  Shape center: (20, 30)
  Shape radius: 20 (corrupted)

Test 5 - Multiple instances:
  s2.radius = 25
  s1.area = 314.159000 (unchanged)
